		 (c) Any form of expression of the Subject Matter;
		 (d) Intellectual Property made or modified using the Subject Matter.

	6. Trademarks

		6.1. The author grants unrestricted permission to use, reproduce, display, modify, parody, criticize, or otherwise exploit any trademark, service mark, logo, or trade name included in the Subject Matter, for any purpose, including commercial use.

	8. Moral Rights Waiver

		8.1. The author waives all moral rights, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to rights of attribution, integrity, disclosure, and withdrawal.

		10.2. This includes, without limitation, liability for reputational, consequential, incidental, indirect, punitive, or exemplary damages, and any claim for defamation, or loss of goodwill.

	11. Compatibility

		11.1. The Subject Matter may be combined, merged, linked, or distributed with other Intellectual Property under any license.

		11.2. Any such combination shall still comply with the Share-alike Condition of Section 5.2 with respect to any Dependent Intellectual Property derived from the Subject Matter.
	
	12. Termination

        Subject to applicable law, the rights granted under this License shall automatically terminate upon any breach of its terms or conditions.

        13.2. Retaliation. If You institute Intellectual Property litigation (as defined in Section 1.1) against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) asserting that the Subject Matter or Dependent Intellectual Property constitutes direct or contributory infringement of Your Intellectual Property rights, then all rights granted to You under this License shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. Termination under this Section shall remain in effect until the terminated License holder complies with the conditions of Section 14 (Reinstatement).

    14. Reinstatement

        14.1. Termination under Section 12 or Section 13.2 shall remain in effect until the terminated License holder fully complies with the following two conditions:

         (a) Provide License Copy: The terminated License holder provides the affected entity with a written copy of this License that fully covers the Subject Matter and Dependent Intellectual Property relevant to the action; and

         (b) Restitution of Seized Assets: The terminated License holder fully restores to the affected entity all assets, property, or monetary amounts seized, paid, or otherwise surrendered by the affected entity pursuant to any judgment, penalty, or government action directly resulting from the terminated License holder’s breach or litigation.
